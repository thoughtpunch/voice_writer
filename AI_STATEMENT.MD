## AI Usage Statement

We are committed to respecting your data privacy and the sanctity of human-written expression. In our open-source library, we optionally use AI to assist with categorizing, labeling, and suggesting elements such as titles for your content. However, we do not train AI models on your content, nor do we share your data with third parties. Your data belongs to you, and you have full control over whether to use AI features or opt out entirely.

For certain features, such as audio transcription, we may use AI libraries like OpenAI's Whisper. However, we ensure that these models run locally in an isolated instance that does not interact with OpenAI APIs or send your data to any third parties.

We will not change this commitment without prior notice to our users.
